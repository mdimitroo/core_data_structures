# Core Data Structures

> A comprehensive collection of data structure implementations with detailed analysis of use-cases, time/space complexities, and associated algorithms.

## Overview

This project aims to implement all major data structures used in computer science, providing:
- **Clean, well-documented implementations** in Python
- **In-depth complexity analysis** (time and space)
- **Use-case explanations** for when to use each data structure

## Data Structures

### [Arrays](./Array/README.md)
A collection of array implementations with different characteristics.

- **Static Array** - Fixed-size array with predictable memory usage
- **Dynamic Array** - Automatically resizing array wrapper around Python's list

### Linked Lists
Coming soon - Various linked list implementations.

- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List

### Stack
Coming soon - LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure.

### Queue
Coming soon - FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure.

### Hash Table
Coming soon - Key-value mapping with average O(1) access time.

## Getting Started

Each data structure directory contains:
- Implementation files (`.py`)
- Detailed README with complexity analysis

Navigate to a specific data structure's directory to learn more about its implementation and usage.

## Notes

- All implementations follow Python best practices
- Code includes comprehensive comments and docstrings
- Each data structure includes complexity analysis documentation
